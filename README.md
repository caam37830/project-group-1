The directory "test", includes all unit tests.

The directory "scripts" includes scripts used to run the simulations. Similar to the sir directory, it contains a seaparate script for each variation.

Finally, the directory "doc" includes subfolders doc/checkpoint and doc/final for the checkpoint and final writeup respectively.
